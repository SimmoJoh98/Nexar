## Overview
- **Name**: #EdenisPrime
- **Location**: Located in the heart of the #VeridianSystem, orbiting a binary star system known as #Helion-Solara. It lies at the crossroads of multiple galactic trade routes, marking it as a central point of human civilization.
- **Type**: Terrestrial
- **Diameter/Size**: Approximately 2.2 times the size of Earth, large enough to house trillions while allowing space for extensive nature preserves.
- **Gravity**: Slightly stronger than Earth’s, at about 1.3g, which has led to somewhat subtle physical adaptations in its human population over millennia.
- **Day Length**: 28 hours, with a slower rotational axis compared to Earth, giving longer daylight and night cycles.
- **Orbit**: #EdenisPrime's orbit around its twin suns is 420 Earth days long, providing an extended year and a variety of nuanced seasonal patterns.
## Climate & Environment
- **Temperature**: The temperature ranges from temperate in most regions to slightly tropical in equatorial zones. The polar regions maintain a more tundra-like environment due to the twin suns' influence.
- **Weather Patterns**: Due to its advanced technology, many weather patterns are regulated. However, natural rainstorms, lightning, and the occasional stormfront still occur in certain untamed regions.
- **Seasons**: The planet has mild seasonal shifts, but due to the extended year, each season is longer in duration. A balance of technology and natural weather control keeps the climate stable.
- **Natural Resources**: While many resources like high-density metals and rare elements are plentiful, the most critical discovery was the crater beneath the oceans, housing a crystal
  ( #Veiylite) that powers much of #EdenisPrime today.

## Terrain & Geography
- **Continents/Landmasses**: #EdenisPrime features six major landmasses, each home to sprawling megacities interspersed with nature preserves. Notable continents include #Veridon, the seat of government, and #Helvoria, the most technologically advanced and highly populated.
- **Oceans/Rivers/Lakes**: Vast oceans cover about 40% of the planet. Beneath these oceans, the discovery of #Veiylite in a massive crater became a turning point in the planet’s history.
- **Mountains/Volcanoes/Deserts**: While there are towering mountain ranges and ancient volcanic regions, the most notable geological feature is the oceanic crater, now hidden by layers of technological development and research facilities.
- **Unique Augmentation**: The once-buried #Veiylite was infused into the planet’s core, allowing the  #EdenisCollective and the #Executari to harness its energy to the extent that the planet can be used as a massive ship in rare circumstances, a powerful but unstable capability.

## Flora & Fauna
- **Notable Species**: Domesticated species have evolved alongside humanity. Due to genetic modification, some species have developed enhanced abilities, such as extended lifespans or heightened intelligence.
- **Dangerous Wildlife**: Some mutated creatures roam the less regulated nature preserves, their exposure to #Veiylite energy causing dangerous adaptations, such as enhanced strength or bioelectric abilities.
- **Ecosystems**: While most ecosystems are highly managed, some regions are wild by design, containing dense forests, #Veiylite -infused plant life, and rivers that glow faintly with energy from the planet’s core.

## Civilization & Culture
- **Dominant Civilization(s)**: The #EdenisCollective rules the planet, a government led by the Council of the most intelligent individuals. This Council, formed by the nation known as #Veridar, was the faction that won the #WarOfTheVeins , securing control over the #Veiylite 's power. They are led by the #Executari, a figure who undergoes the #TrialOfTheCore to become a living conduit of the #Veiylite ’s power.
- **Population**: Approximately 20 trillion, with much of the population living in massive vertical cities that stretch miles into the sky.
- **Technology Level**: The technological level is at its peak, powered by #Veiylite 's energy. The cities are self-sustaining, with innovations in AI, biotech, and space travel.
- **Cultural Traits**: Society highly values intellect and progress. The pursuit of knowledge, perfection in both body and mind, and the collective good are central cultural pillars. The #Veridar continues to influence societal norms with a focus on discipline, order, and advancement.
- **Key Cities/Settlements**: #VeridonMetalis is the capital, home to the Council and the #Executari. #HelvoriaSpire is a technological marvel, while #Cruscara is known for being the site where the #TrialOfTheCore is held.

## History
- **Discovery/Colonization**: Humanity’s recorded history begins on #EdenisPrime, marking it as the cradle of civilization. Early in its history, humanity discovered the deep oceanic crater that housed the alien crystal known as #Veiylite. This discovery catapulted the planet into a rapid technological revolution.
- **Major Events**: The discovery of the crystal beneath the oceans led to the #WarOfTheVeins , a series of conflicts over control of the crystal and its power. The #Veridar emerged victorious, establishing the #EdenisCollective and laying the foundation for the planet’s future.
- **Conflicts**: The #WarOfTheVeins was a planetary civil war fought over control of the crystal. The war ended with the formation of the #EdenisCollective, led by #Veridar

## Strategic Importance
- **Political Importance**: As the birthplace of humanity and the controller of the crystal’s power, #EdenisPrime holds unparalleled political significance. It is a symbol of human progress and power in the Veridian system.
- **Military Presence**: The planet is heavily fortified, with orbital defense platforms, military academies, and fleets stationed in nearby space. The crystal’s energy also powers advanced planetary defense systems, enabling the planet to defend itself as though it were a massive ship.
- **Economic Importance**: Control over the crystal has made #EdenisPrime an economic powerhouse. The crystal, rare and highly valuable, is sought after in interstellar and extra-stellar space for its potential.

## Miscellaneous
- **Languages Spoken**: The primary language is #VeridianStandard, but many dialects and languages from Earth’s past have been preserved as academic curiosities.
- **Affiliations**: #EdenisPrime is the seat of the Veridian Federation, a loose alliance of human-settled planets.
- **Notable Individuals**: The current #Executari is unknown to the public until the Trials of the Core reveal the new leader.
