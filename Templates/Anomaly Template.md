# Anomaly Name

## Overview
- **Name**: (What is the anomaly called?)
- **Classification**: (Creature, spatial distortion, time violation, reality breach, etc.)
- **Discovery**: (Who discovered it? When and where was it first observed?)
- **Rarity**: (How rare is this anomaly? One-of-a-kind, few known instances, etc.)
- **Current Status**: (Is the anomaly contained, active, dormant, or missing?)
- **Category of Violation**: (Which laws of physics, biology, or logic does this anomaly defy?)

## Description
- **Physical Appearance/Structure**: (If applicable, describe its physical form or observable characteristics. Does it have a form at all, or is it invisible/unknowable?)
- **Size/Dimensions**: (What is its size or dimensional properties? Does it shift or remain stable?)
- **Behavior/Patterns**: (Describe any behaviors or observable patterns. Does it move, grow, replicate, or interact with the environment?)
- **Sounds/Signals**: (Does it emit any sounds, signals, or vibrations? If so, describe them.)

## Effects
- **Primary Effects**: (What immediate effects does it have on the environment, objects, or people? Distortions, physical changes, hallucinations, etc.)
- **Secondary Effects**: (Are there lingering or delayed effects? Long-term consequences or unexpected anomalies it triggers?)
- **Range of Influence**: (How far does its influence extend? Is it localized or can it affect things on a planetary scale?)
- **Interaction with Reality**: (How does it interact with the physical world? Does it manipulate time, space, matter, or energy?)
- **Known Reactions**: (How do living creatures, technology, or other anomalies react to it? Does it attract, repel, or corrupt things?)

## Theoretical Explanations
- **Scientific Theories**: (What do scientists and scholars believe about the anomaly? Are there any proposed theories explaining its origin or nature?)
- **Unexplainable Aspects**: (What aspects of the anomaly cannot be explained by current knowledge? What makes it truly “impossible”?)
- **Mythological/Religious Beliefs**: (Are there any myths, folklore, or religious stories that mention or explain the anomaly?)

## Known Interactions
- **Encounters**: (Detail any notable encounters with the anomaly. Who has witnessed or interacted with it? What happened?)
- **Containment Efforts**: (Has there been any attempt to contain or control the anomaly? How successful were these efforts?)
- **Damage or Impact**: (What kind of damage or impact has the anomaly caused? Cities destroyed, lives lost, etc.)
- **Research/Study**: (Are there ongoing efforts to study or understand it? Who is involved, and what have they learned?)

## Origin
- **Place of Origin**: (Where did it originate? A specific planet, void in space, or alternate dimension?)
- **Time of Origin**: (Does it come from a specific time period, or does it exist outside of normal time?)
- **Theories of Creation**: (What are the theories regarding its creation? Is it a natural event, an experiment gone wrong, or something else?)

## Risk & Containment
- **Risk Level**: (How dangerous is the anomaly? High, moderate, or low threat? Could it destabilize entire planets, dimensions, or universes?)
- **Containment Protocols**: (What containment or neutralization methods have been attempted? What works, if anything?)
- **Known Weaknesses**: (Does it have any known weaknesses or vulnerabilities? Can it be destroyed, contained, or reversed?)
- **Escalation Potential**: (Can the anomaly grow or expand? Is there a risk of it evolving or worsening over time?)

## Strategic Importance
- **Military/Political Value**: (Does the anomaly have potential military or political uses? Can it be weaponized, or does its existence have political ramifications?)
- **Economic Value**: (Does the anomaly have any economic implications? Could it be exploited for rare resources or technology?)
- **Cultural/Religious Significance**: (Does the anomaly have cultural, spiritual, or religious importance? Is it worshiped or feared?)

## Impact on the World/Universe
- **Societal Impact**: (How has knowledge of the anomaly affected society? Panic, reverence, denial, etc.)
- **Changes to Natural Laws**: (Does its presence affect the laws of nature, physics, or magic within its area of influence?)
- **Long-term Consequences**: (What are the long-term effects or changes caused by the anomaly? Has it reshaped landscapes, civilizations, or space itself?)

## Miscellaneous
- **Additional Notes**: (Any extra information or hypotheses that don’t fit in the other categories.)
- **Visual Reference (Optional)**: (Include any images, sketches, or visual representations of the anomaly, if applicable.)
